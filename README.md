This repository contains a case study analyzing a significant data breach and ransomware incident that impacted MOVR, a logistics company. The study details the incident timeline, root cause analysis, and recommended actions to enhance cybersecurity practices.

## Files in this Repository

- **CaseStudy.pdf**: A comprehensive report on the incident, including an incident timeline, root cause analysis, and recommendations for strengthening cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents.

## Project Overview

### 1. Incident Overview
The case study outlines the December 11th data breach and ransomware attack:
- **Detection and Resolution**: Incident detected on December 11th and resolved by December 17th.
- **Severity**: Classified as a high-severity data breach and ransomware attack affecting both service operations and sensitive customer data.
- **Impact**: The incident compromised 150+ employee devices and resulted in a ransom demand.

### 2. Executive Summary
- **Initial Attack**: Compromised credentials due to a phishing attack, leading to unauthorized access and a ransomware infection across business devices.
- **Company Impact**: Operational disruptions, loss of customer confidence, and significant reputational damage.

### 3. Incident Timeline
- **Detection Phase**: Began with the deletion of database records, leading to an eight-hour service disruption.
- **Containment**: Security teams identified the source, reset passwords, and ended compromised sessions.
- **Eradication**: Due to delays, MOVR chose to pay the ransom for system restoration.
- **Recovery**: Customer communications and partial record recovery resumed operations.

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
- **Initial Attack Vector**: Phishing email granted the attacker access to employee accounts.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Lack of regular cybersecurity training, weak password management, and insufficient access controls.

### 5. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
- **Training**: Establish mandatory cybersecurity training.
- **Access Controls**: Regularly review access permissions to enforce least privilege.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct frequent audits to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ensure consistent MFA usage with regular logout prompts.
